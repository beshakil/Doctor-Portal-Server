## Actually, This is a Medical Healthcare related website where someone can get--
1. Developed front-end user experience using, Material UI, React v6, Node.js & MongoDB. Implemented the React Router DOM to allow nested RESTful routing.
2. Built app with React while managing State through Asynchronous Actions using Firebase Authentication & payment gateway. This web app is user-friendly as it is responsive.
2. This website lets you know about doctor details, booking appointments by selecting a date, & patient feedback with ratings. Having an admin panel allows you to easily control everything from the website's dashboard.
4. Used to build the website is a combination of react-bootstrap and node.js, which makes the website's loading speed very fast and user-friendly.
5. As this is a health-related website, we provide an emergency ambulance service. So anyone can get emergency health service from this medical center.
6. We also provide our doctor's details and contact details for any consultation.
